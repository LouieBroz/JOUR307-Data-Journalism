#Installing Jupyter Notebook, Git and Agate on your computer


1. First, download and install Anaconda on your computer. You can download it here: [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) WARNING: It will take up 845MB of your hard drive. Install the version for Python 3.5. 
2. Open your terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type: `conda list`
3. If a big stream of text goes by, you've got Anaconda installed. You're done. We'll do the rest in class.
4. If you get an error or nothing happens, come find me. 


This set of installation instructions will update on Thursday.
