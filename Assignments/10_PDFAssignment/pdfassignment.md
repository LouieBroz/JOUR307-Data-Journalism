# Converting PDFs: Doing the Lord's work

### Assignment

Download your target PDF. Convert it into something useful using CometDocs. Then clean it into something you can import into Agate in Jupyter Notebooks. To get credit, you must turn in your csv file that you create and your Jupyter Notebook showing that you imported it and printed out the file structure.
