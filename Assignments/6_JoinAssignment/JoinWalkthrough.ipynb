    "Often, in data, we have one set of information stored in a table over here, and another set of information stored in a table over here. At the university, your student records are scattered in tables all over. Somewhere, there is a master student record, that has your name, birthdate, ID number, home address and other basic info. Then, over in the registrars office, we have the classes you took and the grades you received. Over here, we have the bursars office, which shows how much you owe in tuition and how much you've paid. If we wanted to get a single table together that showed how much you paid for each grade you got, we'd have to JOIN them together somehow. \n",

They are the Free and Reduced Lunch participation totals for every school in Nebraska. I want you to join them together into a single table and calculate the percent change from 2015 to 2016 and sort them by the largest change. Which school in Nebraska saw the largest increase in participation in free and reduced school lunches, which is a proxy for poverty? \n",

So you're going to have to implement [overriding Agate's type inferences](http://agate.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.0/cookbook/create.html#override-type-inference), which is not hard."
