# But first: The records request project

* Throughout the semester, you are going to have to request and acquire a dataset from the state government that is not online. 
* You will have all semester long to do this. 
* You must document everything you do, each answer you get from the agency, what you ultimately end up with. 
* You will submit your data and give a lightning talk about your experience on Nov. 30. 
* DO NOT BLOW THIS OFF. Failure to get something is an F. This may take you a week. This may take you all semester.

# Things you can do with data

- View it
- Sort it
- Select things from it
- Exclude things from it
- Group like things together
- Calculate things.

# Things you can do with data: Calculate things edition

- Count things (usually have to group them first)
- Measure the middle (averages and medians)
- Measure change (percent change)
- Calculate rates (compare NYC to Lincoln)

---

# Count things

- Raw data versus summary data
- Normalized data
- Demo with Mountain Lions

---

# Measure the middle

- The difference between average and median
- Demo with NU salaries
- When to use medians vs when to use averages

---

# Measure change

- The sad state of newsroom math skills
- Numeric change vs percent change
- Repeat after me: New - Old / Old
- Orders of operations: PEMDAS. 
- So repeat after me: (New - Old) / Old. 
- Demo of UCR data

# Calculate rates

- Rates: Make big numbers comprehensible and disparate things comparable
- Choose a base.
- (Number/Total) = Proportion
- Proportion x Z where Z is the number of people you want to calculate the rate for. 1,000? 100,000?

# For next time

- Read Herzog Chapter 8
- Read Numbers in the Newsroom 1 and 2
- Bring your laptop. We get hands on next time.
