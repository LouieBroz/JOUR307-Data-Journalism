# Public records: The lifeblood of investigative reporting

# Public records
* Sunlight is the best disinfectant
* You paid for it. It’s yours... ish.
* Journalism is about holding the powerful accountable for their actions.

# Public records

* Your access to public records and public meetings is a matter of the law.
* As a journalist, it is your job to know this law better than most lawyers.
* Which law applies depends on which branch of government you are asking.

# Public records

* The Federal Government is covered by the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA.
* FOIA is not a universal term. Do not use it if you are not talking to a federal agency.
* FOIA is a beacon of openness to the world.
* FOIA is deeply flawed and frustrating.

# Public records

* There is no real timetable with FOIA. Requests can take months, even years.
* As a journalist, you can ask that your request be expedited. * Guess what? That requires review. More delays.
* Exemptions are broad. National security, personal privacy, often overused.

# Public records

* Denied? You can appeal. More delays.
* The law was enacted in 1966, but it’s still poorly understood by most federal employees. 
* Post 9/11, the Bush administration rolled back many agency rules. Obama ordered a “presumption of openness” but followed it with some of the most restrictive policies ever seen. 
* Result? FOIA is in trouble.

# Public records

* States are generally much more open. 
* Some states, like Florida and Texas, are very open. Others, like Virginia and Pennsylvania, are not. 
* Nebraska? Somewhere in the middle. Better than some, worse than others.

# Public records
Under Nebraska law: 

* You are entitled to see and copy public records.
* They can charge you a fee for those copies.
* They do not have to give you records in a format different from what they keep them in.
---
# Public records
* With a written request, Nebraska public officials have four days to respond.
* If Nebraska public officials deny your request, they must do so in writing specifying their reasons.
* If it will take more than four days, they must tell you, in writing, why and how long it will take.

# Asking for records
* Please and thank you will get you more records than any lawyer or well written request.
* When requesting data, you are going to scare the press office and you are going to confuse the agency lawyer. Request to have their data person on the phone.
* Be. Nice.

# Asking for records

Hunting for records is like any other kind of reporting -- you have to do research. You have to ask questions. 
* What records do you keep? For how long?
* A good source of info? [Records retention schedules](http://www.sos.ne.gov/records-management/retention_schedules.html).

# The records request project

* Throughout the semester, you are going to have to request and acquire a dataset from the state government that is not online. 
* You will have all semester long to do this. 
* You must document everything you do, each answer you get from the agency, what you ultimately end up with. 
* You will submit your data and give a lightning talk about your experience on Nov. 30. 
* DO NOT BLOW THIS OFF. Failure to get something is an F. This may take you a week. This may take you all semester.
