# Assignment

- Using farm data from the USDA, calculate the following:
- The percent change in the total money made on all commodities in Nebraska from 2010 to 2016.
- The percent change in beef receipts from 2010 to 2016 in Nebraska.
- The percent change in corn receipts from 2010 to 2016 in Nebraska.
- The percent of total receipts corn represents. The same for beef. 
- Does using 2010 tell the whole story? What is a better number for showing Nebraska's ag woes?
