# What we're going to get done today

1. Using functions in formulas
2. Min, max, average, median and rank
3. But does anyone see the problem here? 
4. Reliability, replicability, transparency.

# Does anyone see the problem here?

- How confident were you that you could talk someone through everything you did?
- How about if the analysis got complicated? 
- Or if you needed to do substantial data cleaning or manipulation?

# The problem is Reliability, Replicability and Transparency

- Reliability: How sure are we that we got the right answer? That we've done everything correctly?
- Replicability: If we had to do it all again, would we get the same answer? If someone else did it, would they?
- Transparency: If our results are challenged, can we show exactly what we've done to defend it?

# Assignment

In the next class, be prepared to answer this question: If you had to explain how you got the answers to this and the previous assignment to an editor, how comfortable are you that you could do that? Could that editor follow your explanation and get the same answers? How confident of that are you?
