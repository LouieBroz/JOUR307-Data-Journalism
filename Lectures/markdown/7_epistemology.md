# Data is not Truth

# Truth vs truth
---
# Are we seeking the truth?

- What is truth?
- Are we seeking pure truth?
- If not, what are we seeking?
- Knowledge, data, information
- That brings in epistemology

# [Epistemology: How we know what we know.](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/)

---
# What does this have to do with journalism? Doubt.

# In class

- Group 1: Is the unemployment rate accurate? Why or why not?
- Group 2: What, exactly, is Lincoln's population? Is it accurate? Why or why not?
---
# Group reports

---
# Why talk about this? Because it determines how we write.

---
# What are numbers?

- Numbers tell you what.
- Numbers rarely tell you why.
- What do you want to know? Why.

---
# Writing with numbers

- Use ratios instead of percents
- 6 of 10, 2 of 5, etc. 
- Use the exact number only when the exact number is the story.
- Examples: Murders. Lincoln's population.

---
# Writing with numbers

- More than, not over.
- About, not around.
- About, not approximately

---
# Writing with numbers

- Use numbers to illustrate
- "As compared to what?"
- A compared to B. Approvals to denials. This versus the average.
