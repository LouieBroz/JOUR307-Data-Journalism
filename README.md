#JOUR407 Data Journalism#

__Course description:__  

Every day, more of our lives is being stored in a database somewhere. With that explosion of data, journalists now more than ever need the skills to analyze and understand data to then produce the stories hidden in the information. In this class, we’ll use brainpower and software to look at raw data -- not summarized and already reported information -- to do investigative reporting. We’re going to get our hands dirty with spreadsheets, databases, maps and some basic stats. And we're going to do journalism. So buckle up and hold on.
