__Course description:__  

Every day, more of our lives is being stored in a database somewhere. With that explosion of data, reporters more than ever need the skills to analyze and understand data to then write the stories hidden in the information. Gone are the days when a reporter could grab a notebook and say “I suck at math.” If that’s what you aspire to, leave now. Don’t want to be that reporter? Welcome to data journalism. The best reporters harness the right tools to get the story. In this class, we’ll use brainpower and software to look at raw data -- not summarized and already reported information --  to do investigative reporting. We’re going to get our hands dirty with spreadsheets, databases, maps, some basic stats and, time permitting, some stuff I’ll call “serious future s**t.” And in the end, we’ve got a project to produce. So buckle up and hold on.

__Course goals:__  

* Understand the basics of data and data journalism
* Master the use of data in journalistic storytelling
* Master spreadsheets and basic data visualization for storytelling
* Use public records laws and understand your rights as a citizen and a journalist
* Gain exposure to advanced tools of data journalism, like GIS and social network analysis, as well as advanced methods of gathering data.

__Required Materials:__  

* A functioning laptop computer that you must bring with you to class every time and ~800 MB of free hard drive space.
* The administrative priviledges to install software on your computer.
* A copy of Microsoft Excel. The MS Office suite is $20 at the UNL Computer Store.
* [An up-to-date version of Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Free!
* [The Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/) Free! 
* Online materials and class handouts, as needed.
* A sense of humor.

__Grading:__  

The grading will be based on the stories you produce, the work you put into them and your participation in class. 

The bulk of the graded work in this class is as follows:

|Assignment|Percentage of your grade|
|----------|------------------------|
|Four enterprise stories|70%|
|Data negotiation|20%|
|Data diaries|5%|
|Class participation/attendance|5%|

_Enterprise stories_: You will be required to pitch and execute four data journalism stories on your own during the semester. The stories must include original analysis of data you have obtained, a graphic or visualization of that data and a story worth publishing on NewsNetNebraska. Each story will be line edited and produced for online at an appointed time outside of class.

_Data negotiation_: During the semester, you will identify a database held by a government agency that you need for a story and go get it. You are negotiating for public data as a journalist, you may not promise to not use the records. Downloading data from the Internet does not fulfill the requirements of this exercise. You will be assigned a deadline for your dataset, and on your deadline day, you will give a 5-min. lightning talk about your experience along with a written report. We will discuss details in class.

_Data diaries_: Throughout your analysis of data, you need to keep a running diary of what you have done -- what actions you took, commands you ran, thinking behind what you are doing. Yes, it will seem odd, but think of it like writing future you a note explaining how to do this again.

_Class participation and attendance_: You are bad at college if you don't know what this means. Get involved in class, speak up, ask questions, challenge ideas and you'll get the points. Sit on your hands, do nothing, skip class and you will not like what happens.

__Notes on attendance:__  

Yes, we all get sick. Yes, things happen. I don’t want you to be sick in my class any more than you want to be sick. You’ve got no fewer than four ways to get ahold of me, including my cell number. If you are going to miss class, tell me before class. We’ll work it out. But you have to tell me before class for me to help you.

This said: this class builds each class onto the next one. Miss a class and you are behind. We’re going to be covering a lot of new material in this class. Miss one at your own peril.

__The short version on policies regarding academic integrity, diversity and students with disabilities:__  

You cheat, you fail, no exceptions. 

If I’m doing something that’s keeping you from learning, tell me. Tell the Dean. Tell someone, because that’s not cool. I won’t tolerate it from myself and you shouldn’t either.

Now, the longer versions:

__Academic integrity:__  

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors. Academic dishonesty includes:

*  handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.
*  turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
*  turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,
*  using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.

Anything and everything you include in your papers that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions. 
Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.  

__Students with disabilities:__ 

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.  

__Diversity:__  

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professional communicators in a global society. As communicators, we understand that journalism, advertising and other forms of strategic communication must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable. We fail as journalists if we are not accurate in our written, spoken and visual reports; including diverse voices and perspectives improves our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create advertising that reflects a diverse society and, thus, appeals to broader audiences.

##Class Schedule:##
